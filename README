Web Typography for the Lonely

Web typography for the Lonely is a working collection of experiments in contemporary web design focusing on bleeding-edge standards implementations such as SVG, Html5 Canvas and Css3. It is mostly Javascript based and represents my journey into the depths of browser based interactivity. It is a working project and a learning process, therefore none of this code is claimed to be bulletproof or even bee-bee proof for that matter, but is instead meant to inspire and teach.

Current goals for this project involve moving experiments out of libraries such as jquery and raphael.js and focusing purely on supported standards and javascript backed by more progressive-style support libraries like SVGweb and Excanvas.
